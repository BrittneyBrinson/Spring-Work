 <h1>The die rolled on: </h1>
<!-- What I need to do in steps.-->
<!-- Passing data to views-->
<!-- step 1: create a page with the mapping to "/roll-dice/n". Next this page should ask the user(ME) to guess a number
       step 2: The page should have links to number one through 6(Reference the guess through variables) AKA Say your guess was).
        step 3: The form on the page should make a get request to /roll/-dice/n (n is the number guessed ()))
           step 4: The page must show a random number(die roll), the users guess, message if they (I)guessed correctly-->

<form action="/roll-dice" method="post">
    <h2> Guess a number from 1 to 6!</h2>
    <input type="text" name="number"/>
    <button>Submit</button>
</form>
<h2>Your guess was: <span th:text="${n}"></span></h2>

 </form>
</body>
</html>


<!--show page âœ…-->
<!--get info from view(html(number guessed))-->
<!--pass info from controller to view (dice number) use logic to tell if guess was correct or not-->
